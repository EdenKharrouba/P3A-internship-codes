# P3A-internship-codes
This repository contains the Matlab codes and FIJI Macro that I created during my internship. It also contains folders with data files I used to analyse to allow you test the codes.
In case you are testing the Matlab codes, please remember to change the name of the excel files resuming the results at the end of the code. If an excel file with the same name already exist in the results folder you choose, Matlab won't write the new one. 

The folder Behavioral analysis is related to my analysis of Ultrasonic Vocalisations
The folder Modlecular analysis is related to my analysis of Immunohistochemistry images
